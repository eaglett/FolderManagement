# FolderManagement
This Powershell script takes care of duplicate folders that can occur when moving folders on Sharepoint. The site has to be synced to a local windows machine.

Folders are merged locally and then OneDrive takes care of updating the changes on the Sharepoint.

The script is adapted to our folder naming convention and it should be adjusted if it's used externally.
